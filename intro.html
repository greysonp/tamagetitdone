        <h2>Your New Friend, Tommy!</h2>
        <p>
            Let me introduce you to Tommy, your new digital pet! Unlike most pets, Tommy has 
            one goal: to make you more productive. He does that through the use of a cool
            to-do list! If you have things to do, he'll be sure you get them done :)
        </p>

        <h2>Your New To-Do List</h2>
        <p>
            You can access the to-do list either through the new tab page or the little Tommy icon
            on your menu bar. The to-do list has a few cool features that you'll enjoy:
        </p>
        <h3>Automatic Date Recognition</h3>
        <p>
            Why should you have to manually enter in due dates? This to-do list is smart enough
            that it will auto-recognize the dates you enter in natural language. Try entering the
            following tasks in this order:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Finish my report by next Friday</li>
            <li>Call my mom tonight at 11pm</li>
            <li>Hand in my marketing homework in two days</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You'll notice that as you add the tasks, they'll be sorted in the order they're due!
            Pretty nice, huh?
        </p>
        <h3>Tagging</h3>
        <p>
            We know that everyone likes to organize their list a little differently, so instead of 
            forcing a set structure on you, this to-do list has a build-your-own organization 
            philosophy. We have simply given you the ability to add tags. To do so, simply add a 
            word with a hashtag in front of it. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do my <a href="#" class="tag">#science</a> homework</li>
            <li>Finish the TPS report by tomorrow | <a href="#" class="tag">#work</a></li>
            <li><a href="#" class="tag">#p1</a> | Water the garden before I leave for vacation tomorrow at 8am</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In just those few examples, you can see the flexibility the tagging system allows: you
            can create your own categories and even your own priority system. To sort by tags, you 
            can either click a tag in the list, or select them from the tag list in the upper right.
        </p>
        <h2>So What Does Tommy Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Tommy keeps you on-task by looking at what sites you're on and how much work you have to do.
            Utilizing OpenDNS domain categorization, Tommy knows what kind of site you're on, be it a 
            social networking site or a business site (but don't worry, Tommy never sends that information
            to anyone). If you have a lot of work to do and are on an unproductive site, Tommy has various
            methods to... annoy you. I'll let you experience them for yourself :)
        </p>
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Tommy is sitting on top of things I need to see. How do I move him?</h3>
        <p>Just click, drag, and throw him around!</p>
        <h3>Tommy is annoying me on a site I actually need to use!</h3>
        <p>
            Tommy can't be right all of the time! If you click the Tommy button on your menu bar to show 
            the to-do list, you'll see a button at the bottom called "Mark this site as productive." Click
            it, and Tommy won't bother you on that site anymore! You can also see the way that site has
            been categorized, so you can understand why he thought it was an unproductive domain.
