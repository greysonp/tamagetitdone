# Tamagetitdone
Tamagetitdone is a productivity-focused digital pet for your browser. 
It still in active development and is not yet ready to be released on the Chrome Web Store.

## Setup
When getting setup, run ```npm install``` to grab the dependencies (just TypeScript at the moment).
You may have to install TypeScript globally to get the compile command ```tsc```. To do so, simply run ```sudo npm install -g typescript```.

## Build
To compile the TypeScript, simply run ```make```. 
To see the changes reflected in the browser, go to ```chrome://extensions``` and reload the page.

## Running in Chrome
You can load the extension in Chrome by going to ```chrome://extensions```, entering Developer mode, selecting 'Load unpacked extension...', and pointing it to the root of the Tamagetitdone directory.
